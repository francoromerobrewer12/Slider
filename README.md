WELCOME TO SLIDER PROJECT!

This project was built to use the map function on an array of objects and get a slider effect that we frequently see in almost every website.

By using the index to track the object I want to show on screen, I dinamically change the className of the article component. 

At the same time it was a project used to practice some React Hooks such us useState and useEffect.
